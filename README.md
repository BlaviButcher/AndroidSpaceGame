# AndroidSpaceGame
This was done on gitLab through our University. Unfortunately they delete everything at the end of the semester. We had to use the SCRUM methodolgy to do our project so that was
a good time. I think I have the files on stackedit, so I will add those at some stage.

Basically, the aim of the game is to fling a laser from your space craft to hit that planet at the other end. Watch out for asteroids and also the gas giant (or black hole, big
debate) has gravity.

Unfortunately because of the way the assignment was worded we had to use onFling rather than a modified onDrag, so the fling can be a bit funny ie drag your finger for a while.
Overall we got 98%. We were planning to expand it further now that the assignment is over and we aren't restricted by it's bounds, but life got in the way. 

Enjoy! Please throw criticsm or ideas our way if you see fit.
